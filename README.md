## Portfolio Website:
___
This is my portfolio website where I showcase some of my projects, my skills and myself in general. Not much heavy stuff here. Simple website to show some works.
Not much work on backend so after going back and forth on whether to use Google docs or Firebase to collect messages from the form, Finally opt to use Firebase because it is cool. Also I wanted to use Firebase. But there is a branch where I use google docs.

Front end: React.js, Javascript, HTML/CSS
back end: Firebase/ Google docs
